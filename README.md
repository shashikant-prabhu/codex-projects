# codex-projects

This repository contains a simple Python project for converting the contents of
text files to lowercase. The project includes a small submodule as an example of
structuring code in subpackages.

## Usage

The main function `convert_file_to_lowercase` reads a file and replaces its
content with a lowercase version.

```
from lowercase_converter import convert_file_to_lowercase

convert_file_to_lowercase("path/to/file.txt")
```

The subproject exposes `count_lines` which returns the number of lines in a
file.

```
from lowercase_converter.subproject import count_lines

num = count_lines("path/to/file.txt")
```

## Running Tests

Tests use `pytest`. Install the requirements and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```


## Duplicate File Cleaner

A Flask-based web utility is included for detecting and removing duplicate files.
Run the application with:

```
python -m duplicate_file_cleaner.webapp
```
Enter the directory to scan or select **Scan entire system**. You can limit the
search to specific file types such as images, videos, PDF or Word documents and
navigate the folder hierarchy using the builtâ€‘in browser. Review the duplicates
found and confirm deletion. The tool keeps the oldest copy of each duplicate set
and logs removals to `duplicate_cleaner.log` while reporting the freed disk
space.

### New Features

* Browsing directories now supports pagination to avoid overly long lists.
* You can limit the number of directories scanned per phase and estimate scan
  time before running a full search.
* Deletion history is stored in a local SQLite database located in your home
  directory and can be viewed from the application's main page.
